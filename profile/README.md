# **GESSI - NLP4SE**  

This research line explores **state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)** to improve and extend **software engineering** tasks, including:  
- 📄 Requirements specification  
- 🛠️ Code generation  
- 📊 Feedback analysis  

We also investigate how **large language models (LLM)** can create new opportunities to innovate and enhance these tasks. Our mission is to provide **open-source tools** for both researchers and practitioners, contributing to the field from both **scientific** and **technical** perspectives.
