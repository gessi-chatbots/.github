# **GESSI - NLP4SE**  

This research line explores **state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)** to improve and extend **software engineering** tasks, including:  
- 📄 Requirements specification  
- 🛠️ Code generation  
- 📊 Feedback analysis  

We also investigate how **large language models (LLM)** can create new opportunities to innovate and enhance these tasks. Our mission is to provide **open-source tools** for both researchers and practitioners, contributing to the field from both **scientific** and **technical** perspectives.

## 📁 **Projects**
### **APIs documentation**  
All the APIs endpoints and documentation can be found in the [GESSI - NLP4SE Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/gessi-fib-upc/gessi-nlp4se)
### 🔄 **RE-Miner Orchestration**  
Deploy and manage the entire ecosystem easily with **[RE-Miner Orchestrator](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Orchestration)**.  
This orchestration provides a **Docker Compose** setup that automates service configuration and execution.

Alternatively, you can **manually clone** and **configure** each service for greater customization or to fit separate environments.
