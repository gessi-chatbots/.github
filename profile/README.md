# GESSI - NLP4SE 

This research line explores state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) to improve and extend software engineering tasks, including requirements specification, code generation, and feedback analysis. We also investigate how large language models (LLM) can improve these tasks and create new opportunities.

Our goal is to provide open-source tools for researchers and practitioners, contributing both scientifically and technically.

## Projects:

### RE-Miner 2.0
- [RE-Miner Dashboard](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Dashboard)
- [RE-Miner Dashboard BFF](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Dashboard-BFF)
- [RE-Miner Hub](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Hub)
- [MApp-KG](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/app_data_repository)

### RE-Miner ecosystem
All microservices that are part of the RE-Miner Ecosystem and can be downloaded along with RE-Miner 2.0:

#### Type Analysis
- [RE-Miner Type Analysis](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-type-analysis)

#### Topic Analysis
- [RE-Miner Topic Analysis](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-topic-analysis)

#### Feature Clustering
- [FeaClustRE (Feature Clustering)](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/FeaClustRE)

#### Polarity Analysis
- [RE-Miner Polarity Analysis](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-polarity-analysis)

#### Feature Extraction
- [TransFeatEx](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/NLP_pipeline)
- [T-Frex](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/t-frex)

#### Emotion Classification
- [Emotion Classification (BERT & BETO)](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/TSA-BERT-V2)

#### RE-Miner Orchestration
To simplify the deployment and management of all services, use the **[RE-Miner Orchestration](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Orchestration)**, which provides a **Docker Compose** setup to automatically configure and run the entire ecosystem.

Alternatively, you can manually clone and configure each service for greater customization or separate environments.
